This is where the content of the page is defined!

The content of the page is written in Markdown. That file gets converted into HTML when the website is built in [script/make-html.js](script/make-html.js)).

If you are interested in creating a new translation, you can create a new .md file here for that language! The process involves:

1. Make a copy of [content.md](/content.md).
1. Change all the English parts into another language. See [content-es.md](/content-es.md) for an example.
   - If you could also create a translation of the title, that'd be great!
1. Either email the file to me (fourier@jezzamon.com), or send a pull request with the updated file and I'll get it on the website!

Please also make sure to credit yourself! Feel free to add a section at the end of the article.
